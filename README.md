# 1. Klib: Live For Notes

## Focus on Now

The number of books we read is ever-increasing. If we consider all these books together, we will be lost.

**Klib is an app which groups all your read books together in one place. Your ‘read books’ group can be collapsed.** You can even hide the book list and only read the notes.

**Tips:**

- You can select multiple books and mark them as read. It's very useful after doing an import for the first time.
- If you usually read saved web pages in Kindle, with Klib you can merge them together as one book.
- How do you distinguish between highlights and notes?  Easy, Klib notes haves an ✍️ Emoji icon at the beginning of each entry.

## Review Notes in Kindle for macOS

When reviewing notes, you may want to read that part of the book again. In this case, **Klib can open Kindle for macOS and jump to the exact location**. Very cool and useful.

You can also press the `Space` bar in Klib to quickly preview the selected note. Feel familiar?

## Open With Amazon

When reviewing books we sometimes want to view the table of contents, customer reviews, or other books written by same author. In this case, **Klib can open the book on the Amazon site with one click.**

## Free to Edit

In Klib you can freely edit the book title, author, highlights, notes, etc.

## Search Anything

You can search for any of the following content in Klib:

- Book title
- Author
- Note
  - Content
  - Location
  - Date

For example, if I want to search a note with the text `value` which I read in `2017`, just search `2017 value`.

# 2. Klib: Start From Importing

## Import From Kindle

**How to import:**

- Connect your Kindle to your Mac via USB.
- Click the menu `File > Import from Kindle…` in Klib.
- Choose the `Kindle` folder in the pop up dialog and start `Import`.

**Tips:**

- You only need to import manually the first time. Later **Klib will automatically import your notes the next time when your Kindle connected.**
- If you ever deleted any books or notes, and want to restore, just select `Import deleted books or notes` during import.

Disadvantages of Importing this way:

- You need to connect your Kindle via USB each time.
- Doesn't include notes made by Kindle for iPhone or other Kindle clients.

## Import From Amazon

**It is recommended to import from Amazon, which is very easy to use.**

- You can import wirelessly, there’s no need to connect the Kindle via USB.
- You can also import notes made using other Kindle clients.

**How to import:**

- Click the menu item `File > Import from Amazon…` in Klib.
- You need to authorize when importing for the first time.
	- Tip: You need to subscribe to *Klib Extensions* to import from Amazon.
- Later, **Klib will import automatically from Amazon on startup.**

# 3. Klib: Free To Export

Sharing knowledge is a good thing.

## Export To Evernote

After exporting to Evernote, you can easily review your notes via Evernote clients on iPhone or any other device.

**How to export:**

- Click the menu item `File > Export to Evernote…` in Klib.
- You need to authorize when exporting for the first time.
- Later, **Klib will automatically export to Evernote on startup or when importing new notes.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/R3b3Gyq.jpg)

**Tips:**

- A new `Klib` notebook will be created in Evernote.
- Klib also creates the tags `Klib`, `Book`, `Read Book` for content exported into Evernote.
- Klib will override notes in Evernote whenever you modify books or notes.
	- Tips: For this reason the notes in Evernote are read only.

## Copy as Markdown

After copying notes as Markdown, you can easily share them on your blog or anywhere else.

In fact, this is why I developed Klib. After reading a book I like to summarise it in my blog. And the highlights and notes are important parts of the summary. So, I made Klib to copy them as Markdown.

## Export Database

You can easily export Klib’s entire database, and then share it with others, or sync to different computers.

**How to export:**

- Click the menu item `File > Export…` in Klib.
- You can also export only the selected books. Just select the books, then press the `Option` key, and click the `File > Export Selected Book…` menu item in Klib.

**Tips:**

- How to import the exported database? It's the same as with importing from Kindle. Just choose the database file during an import.

# 4. Klib: Great Experience
